# Time Series Forecasting with ARIMA and SARIMA

This repository contains a project for time series forecasting using ARIMA and SARIMA models. The dataset used in this project is seasonal, making SARIMA an appropriate choice. For non-seasonal data, ARIMA models are also applicable.

## Project Overview

Time series forecasting is a crucial component of data analysis, particularly in predicting future values based on previously observed data. This project focuses on using ARIMA (AutoRegressive Integrated Moving Average) and SARIMA (Seasonal ARIMA) models to predict future values in a time series dataset.

### Dataset

The dataset used in this project is titled `perrin-freres-monthly-champagne-.csv`. It contains monthly sales data, which exhibits seasonal patterns, making it an excellent candidate for SARIMA modeling.

### Models Used

- **ARIMA**: This model is used for non-seasonal data. It includes components for autoregression, differencing (to make the data stationary), and moving average.
- **SARIMA**: This model extends ARIMA by adding seasonal components, suitable for datasets with periodic patterns.

### Autoregressive Intergrated Moving Averages
##### The general process for Arima models is the following:
- Visualize the Time Series Data
- Make the time series data stationary
- Plot the Correlation and AutoCorrelation Charts
- Construct the ARIMA Model or Seasonal ARIMA based on the data
- Use the model to make predictions
